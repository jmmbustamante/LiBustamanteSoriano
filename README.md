# BoardBlitz

The website gives the users a group of mechanical keyboards hand-picked by us, to give them the best value for their money. 
The website has two categories: pre-built and custom. Both will have three mechanical keyboards that will have their details and our reviews in it, while showing why and how it has the best value amongst the rest.
